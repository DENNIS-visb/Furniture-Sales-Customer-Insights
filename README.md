# Furniture-Sales-Customer-Insights
This project showcases a one-page interactive dashboard built in Looker Studio to analyze product performance and customer experience for a furniture retail dataset. 

**Problem Statement**

Furniture retailers often face challenges in understanding which product categories drive the most revenue, how brands perform relative to one another, and what factors influence customer satisfaction. Without clear insights, decision-making around inventory, pricing, and customer experience becomes guesswork.

**Goal**

The objective of this project was to transform raw order-level data into actionable business intelligence by applying data cleaning, structured analysis, and dashboard design. The focus was on identifying performance drivers across product categories, brands, and customer feedback to support strategic decision-making in retail operations.

**Data Overview**

The dataset included order-level records with fields such as:

Order ID, Customer ID (unique identifiers)

Product Category & Subcategory

Brand (with some missing values)

Product Price, Shipping Cost, Assembly Cost, Total Amount

Delivery Status (Pending, Delivered, Cancelled, etc.)

Payment Method

Customer Rating (1–5, with some blanks)

Data cleaning steps included handling missing brand names, imputing missing shipping costs, and evaluating blank customer ratings.

**Dashboard Features**

Scorecards: Total Sales, Average Order Value (AOV), Total Orders

Bar Chart: AOV by Product Category

Pie Chart: Sales by Brand

Treemap: Sales by Category with drill-down into Subcategories

Heatmap: Average Customer Ratings across Categories and Brands

**Key Insights**

Living Room and Outdoor categories generated the highest revenue.

Brand-level performance was concentrated among a few leaders, with room for growth.

Customer satisfaction varied across categories, highlighting potential areas for improvement.

AOV analysis showed larger furniture types drove higher order values.

**Outcome**

The final deliverable is a concise, executive-ready dashboard that enables retail managers to monitor revenue drivers, optimize product strategy, and improve customer experience.

This project demonstrates my ability to deliver end-to-end analytics solutions—from data preparation to insight generation—using Looker Studio.
